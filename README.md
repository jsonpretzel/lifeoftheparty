Life of the Party

This is a basic script for use with rpg-cards (https://github.com/crobi/rpg-cards).  It takes a .csv file and converts it into a .json file that can be read into rpg-cards to generate formatted cards.  

The default formatting is to generate cards for use with the card game Life of the Party.

Please see the rpg-cards documentation for formatting options.
