Life of the Party

This script takes a .csv file and converts it into a .json file that can be read into rpg-cards ((https://github.com/crobi/rpg-cards) to generate formatted playing cards.  

The default settings generate card .json data for the game Life Of The Party (https://jsonpretzel.itch.io/life-of-the-party). The .csv file used for the first release of LOTP is included for reference.

Please note that the script is configured to use custom formatting options from a rpg-cards branch made for LOTP (https://github.com/jsonpretzel/rpg-cards/tree/lotp). These additional options include bold, italic, and bolditalic text. If you do not need these, you can use the script with the original rpg-cards. 

Otherwise, please see the rpg-cards documentation for the default card formatting options.
